# EmployMe
[Spigot Plugin](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/employme.96513/) that boosts the economy by adding competitive jobs Anyone can post the job within the Global Jobs Board,\
and the first player to complete it gets rewarded by the Employer!

* **Without** an Economy plugin(e.g. Essentials) EmployMe would shut down.

## Rewards
Employers can pay either by money, or offer an unlimited amount of valuable items.

## Goals
A job is considered finished once a player reaches the goal item - Which is what the employer needs.\
To do that, the player has to have the goal item in the inventory.

## Jobs Board
Currently(Beta) EmployMe has just one **Jobs Board**, which is interactable by a GUI(More types will be added!).
