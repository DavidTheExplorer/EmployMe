# EmployMe
A [Spigot Plugin](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/employme.96513/) that boosts the economy by adding competitive jobs - Anyone can post a job within a Jobs Board, and the fastest player to complete it gets rewarded by the Employer.


* **Without** an Economy plugin, EmployMe would disable itself.

## Rewards
An employer can offer either a money payment, or an unlimited amount of valuable items!

## Goals
A job is considered finished once a player reached all of its goals.\
Right now the goal is having an item in the inventory(This is pretty much the only important goal, but more will be added).

## Jobs Board
Currently(Beta) the plugin has only a **Global Board**, which is implemented using a GUI.

Example of an offered job(Items Reward):
